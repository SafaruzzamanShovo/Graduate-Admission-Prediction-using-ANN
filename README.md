## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the probability of graduate admission based on academic and profile features. The project covers data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction on new data.  
It is ideal for students, researchers, and anyone interested in machine learning for educational analytics.

## Features

- üìä Loads and explores a real-world graduate admission dataset
- üßπ Preprocesses data: feature selection, scaling, train-test split
- üß† Builds a sequential ANN using TensorFlow/Keras
- üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Trains the model with validation and tracks performance
- üìà Evaluates with R¬≤ score and visualizes training history
- üîÆ Predicts admission chances for new applicants

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
              git clone https://github.com/SafaruzzamanShovo/Graduate-Admission-Prediction-using-ANN.git
2. **Install dependencies:**
             pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow

---

## Usage

1. **Download the dataset** from Kaggle or Google Drive (see links above).
2. **Upload the dataset to your Google Drive** if using Colab.
3. **Open the notebook** (`Graduate_Admission_Prediction_using_ANN.ipynb`) in Colab or Jupyter.
4. **Run all cells** to train the ANN and evaluate its performance.
5. **Modify the 'new_data' cell** to predict admission chances for custom applicants.

## Model Architecture

- **Input:** 7 features (GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, GPA, Research)
- **Hidden layers:** 2 Dense layers (7 units each, ReLU activation)
- **Output:** 1 unit (Chance of Admit, linear activation)
- **Loss:** Mean Squared Error
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Epochs:** 150
