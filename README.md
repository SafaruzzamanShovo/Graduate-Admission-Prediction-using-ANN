## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to use an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the probability of graduate admission based on academic and profile features. The project covers data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction on new data.  
It is ideal for students, researchers, and anyone interested in machine learning for educational analytics.

## Features

- 📊 Loads and explores a real-world graduate admission dataset
- 🧹 Preprocesses data: feature selection, scaling, train-test split
- 🧠 Builds a sequential ANN using TensorFlow/Keras
- 🏋️‍♂️ Trains the model with validation and tracks performance
- 📈 Evaluates with R² score and visualizes training history
- 🔮 Predicts admission chances for new applicants
